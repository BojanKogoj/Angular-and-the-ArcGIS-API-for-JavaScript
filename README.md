# *Building Web Applications with ArcGIS API for the JavaScript, using the Angular CLI*

This repository was developed to support the *Esri Dev Summit 2018* presentation of similar name.  In the [samples](https://github.com/sean-olson-esri/2018_dev_summit_arcgis_api_angular_cli/tree/master/samples) directory you will find a number of implementations of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript in Angular (2+) applications, using the [`esri-loader`](https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader).


### In this Repository
Each of the implementations in the ```samples``` directory is accompanied by a README file that will walk you through the given implementation. Here is what you'll find there.
* [1_esri_loader](https://github.com/sean-olson-esri/2018_dev_summit_arcgis_api_angular_cli/tree/master/samples/1_esri_loader) -- a simple *kick-start* implementation.
